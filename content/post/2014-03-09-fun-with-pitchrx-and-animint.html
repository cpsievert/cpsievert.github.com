<p>If you are anything like me, you spend most of the day wrangling data with <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plyr/index.html">plyr</a> (or <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html">dplyr</a>) and visualizing it with <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html">ggplot2</a>. For this reason, I got really excited when I heard about the <a href="https://github.com/tdhock/animint">animint</a> package which allows one to create linked, interactive (even animated) web graphics using ggplot2 code.</p>
<p>This short post demonstrates linked plots using data from the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pitchRx/">pitchRx</a> package. If you click on the bars in the bar chart below, the corresponding start versus end speed scatterplot should change to reflect the current selection. I really want to spend more time with animint since it seems to fill a void where other similar (and also great) packages like <a href="http://rcharts.io/">rCharts</a> and <a href="http://ggvis.rstudio.com/">ggvis</a> currently fall short.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(pitchRx)
pitches$type &lt;- with(
  pitches, 
  interaction(pitch_type, pitcher_name)
)
counts &lt;- dplyr::count(pitches, pitch_type, pitcher_name, type)
library(animint)
viz &lt;- list(
  bars = ggplot() +
    geom_bar(
      aes(x = factor(pitch_type), 
          y = n, fill = pitcher_name, 
          clickSelects = type),
      position = &quot;dodge&quot;, 
      stat = &quot;identity&quot;, 
      data = counts
    ) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;),
  scatter = ggplot() +
    geom_point(
      aes(start_speed, end_speed, 
          fill = pitcher_name, showSelected = type),
      alpha = 0.65, 
      data = pitches)
  )
