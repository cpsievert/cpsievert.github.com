On April 2nd, 2013 Yu Darvish [flirted with pitching
perfection](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/yu-darvish-loses-perfect-game-030913556--mlb.html). To
demonstrate his ability to deceive batters with a consistent delivery over different pitch types,
[redditor DShep created this
gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1d2z6d/all_of_darvishs_primary_pitches_at_once/),
which layers video of five different pitches thrown by Darvish on April 24th:

Cool, huh? Well, I will show you how to 'recreate' a similar 'gif' with publicly available PITCHf/x
data using the [pitchRx](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pitchRx/)
[R](http://cran.r-project.org) package. First, we collect all the pitches thrown by Darvish to
Albert Pujols on April 24th:

```{r scrape, results='hide', message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(pitchRx)
dat <- scrapeFX(start="2013-04-24", end="2013-04-24")
atbats <- subset(dat$atbat, pitcher_name=="Yu Darvish" & batter_name=="Albert Pujols")
pitches <- plyr::join(atbats, dat$pitch, by=c("num", "url"), type="inner")
```

Lets animate these `pitches` using `animateFX`. Note that we take a different perspective from
above by imagining the pitches coming closer as time progresses.

```{r set_hook, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(animation.fun = hook_r2swf)
```

```{r ani, fig.show='animate', fig.align='center', interval=0.05, dev="CairoPNG", cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
animateFX(pitches)
```

One thing to notice here is the different release points by Darvish (especially for his slider).
Furthermore, Darvish didn't even throw a curveball to Pujols. If you look closer at the original
gif, you can actually see a different batter (than Pujols) in the batter's box (look for a white
bat). Darvish's delivery looks very similar on videotape, but his arm angle (and thus) release
point might be slightly different for different pitch types according to the PITCHf/x data. Let's
take a closer look at Darvish's release point during this start.

```{r release, fig.align='center', dev="CairoPNG", fig.width=11}
atbats <- subset(dat$atbat, pitcher_name=="Yu Darvish")
Darvish <- plyr::join(atbats, dat$pitch, by=c("num", "url"), type="inner")
qplot(data=Darvish, x=as.numeric(x0), y=as.numeric(z0), color=pitch_type)+coord_equal()
```

As you can see, Darvish has quite different release points according to pitch type. For example,
his slider tends to be more 'side-arm' compared to his four-seam fastball. Now, whether that
difference is distinguishable to the human-eye is another question...

EDIT: Thanks to a recommendation by [@sky_kalman](https://twitter.com/Sky_Kalkman), normalizing
release points should make it easier to make visual comparison of flight paths across the pitch
types. Here is one way to go about that:

```{r normalized, fig.show='animate', fig.align='center', interval=0.05, dev="CairoPNG", cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
pitches$x0 <- mean(as.numeric(pitches$x0))
pitches$z0 <- mean(as.numeric(pitches$z0))
animateFX(pitches)
```


Lastly, just for fun, let's take an interactive look at Darvish's pitches to Pujols. If your
browser has [WebGL enabled](http://get.webgl.org/), go ahead and play with the object below!

```{r lies, eval=FALSE}
library(rgl)
interactiveFX(pitches)
```

I think it would be awesome to have a similar tool in
[pitchRx](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pitchRx/) for creating 'gifs' with actual video.
If anybody has ideas on how we can connect PITCHf/x data with actual video, please contact me or
leave a comment!
