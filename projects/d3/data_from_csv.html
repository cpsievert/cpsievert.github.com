				//copies it over to a variable, and/or renders the visualization.
				
				//The parsed CSV is passed in as 'data', so here we hand
				//it off to 'myData' for easy access later.
				myData = data;
				
				//Here we print 'myData' to the console, just to verify it loaded
				console.log(myData);

			//Load data from JSON in the same fashion, but with d3.json():

			//	console.log(data);
